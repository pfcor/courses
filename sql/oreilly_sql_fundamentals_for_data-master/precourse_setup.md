# SQL Fundamentals for Data
## Pre-Course Setup

There are two items that need to be downloaded for this course:

* SQLiteStudio
* SQLite database files

SQLiteStudio can be downloaded at the link below.  Choose the correct version for your OS (Windows, Mac or Linux) and it will prompt you to download SQLiteStudio.

https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt?act=download

After the download, **copy** the contents to a location your choice (or Applications for Mac OS X). You must copy the items out of the archive file for it to work, and wherever you paste it is where the SQLite application will reside. Inside this folder, you should see a `SQLiteStudio` or `SQLiteStudio.exe` with a gray cylinder icon. This launches SQLiteStudio (Figure 1)

The database files can be retrieved from GitHub [here](https://github.com/thomasnield/oreilly_sql_fundamentals_for_data). Click the `Clone or Download` button, and then `Download ZIP` to download all the databases in a zipped folder (Figure 2).

Open the downloaded file and copy the contents to a folder of your choice. You may want to reserve this folder just for SQLite database files in this course.


## Book

A lot of material in this class can also be found in the book _Getting Started with SQL_. Read it on O'Reilly or Safari as a reference to many of the topics we will cover.
